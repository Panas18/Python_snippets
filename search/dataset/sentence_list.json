["Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but\n", "was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes. With the ring of light from\n", "his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his\n", "boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the\n", "scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.\n", "    As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a\n", "fluttering all through the farm buildings. Word had gone round during the day\n", "that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange dream on the\n", "previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals. It had been\n", "agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as Mr. Jones was safely\n", "out of the way. Old Major (so he was always called, though the name under\n", "which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on\n", "the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour\u2019s sleep in order to hear\n", "    At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already\n", "ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam. He was\n", "twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-\n", "looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his\n", "tushes had never been cut. Before long the other animals began to arrive and\n", "make themselves comfortable after their different fashions. First came the three\n", "dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the\n", "straw immediately in front of the platform. The hens perched themselves on\n", "the window-sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay\n", "down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. The two cart-horses, Boxer\n", "and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast\n", "hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in\n", "the straw. Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had\n", "never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous\n", "beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put\n", "together. A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance,\n", "and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected\n", "for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work. After the horses\n", "came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the\n", "oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. He seldom talked, and\n", "when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark \u2014 for instance, he\n", "would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would\n", "sooner have had no tail and no flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he\n", "never laughed. If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at.\n", "Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; the two\n", "                                        1\n", "\fof them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the\n", "orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.\n", "    The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost\n", "their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to\n", "side to find some place where they would not be trodden on. Clover made a sort\n", "of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside\n", "it and promptly fell asleep. At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white\n", "mare who drew Mr. Jones\u2019s trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump\n", "of sugar. She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane,\n", "hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with. Last of all came\n", "the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed\n", "herself in between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout\n", "Major\u2019s speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.\n", "    All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who slept\n", "on a perch behind the back door. When Major saw that they had all made\n", "themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and\n", "    \u2018Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had last\n", "night. But I will come to the dream later. I have something else to say first. I\n", "do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many months longer, and\n", "before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom as I have acquired.\n", "I have had a long life, I have had much time for thought as I lay alone in my\n", "stall, and I think I may say that I understand the nature of life on this earth as\n", "well as any animal now living. It is about this that I wish to speak to you.\n", "    \u2018Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our\n", "lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much\n", "food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of\n", "it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that\n", "our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty. No\n", "animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year\n", "old. No animal in England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery:\n", "that is the plain truth.\n", "    \u2018But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land of\n", "ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it?\n", "No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England is fertile, its climate\n", "is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance to an enormously greater\n", "number of animals than now inhabit it. This single farm of ours would support\n", "a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep \u2014 and all of them living in a\n", "comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining. Why then\n", "do we continue in this miserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the\n", "produce of our labour is stolen from us by human beings. There, comrades, is\n", "the answer to all our problems. It is summed up in a single word \u2014 Man. Man\n", "is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause\n", "of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.\n", "    \u2018Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not\n", "give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot\n", "run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them\n", "to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from\n", "starving, and the rest he keeps for himself. Our labour tills the soil, our dung\n", "fertilises it, and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin.\n", "                                        2\n", "\fYou cows that I see before me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have\n", "you given during this last year? And what has happened to that milk which\n", "should have been breeding up sturdy calves? Every drop of it has gone down\n", "the throats of our enemies. And you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this\n", "last year, and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens? The rest\n", "have all gone to market to bring in money for Jones and his men. And you,\n", "Clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should have been the support\n", "and pleasure of your old age?

In return for your four confinements and all your labour in\n", "the fields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall?\n", "    \u2018And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural\n", "span. For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky ones. I am twelve\n", "years old and have had over four hundred children. Such is the natural life of\n", "a pig. But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end. You young porkers\n", "who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will scream your lives out at the\n", "block within a year. To that horror we all must come \u2014 cows, pigs, hens, sheep,\n", "everyone. Even the horses and the dogs have no better fate. You, Boxer, the\n", "very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you\n", "to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds.\n", "As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, Jones ties a brick round\n", "their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.\n", "    \u2018Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours\n", "spring from the tyranny of human beings? Only get rid of Man, and the produce\n", "of our labour would be our own. A1most overnight we could become rich and\n", "free. What then must we do? Why, work night and day, body and soul, for the\n", "overthrow of the human race! That is my message to you, comrades: Rebellion!\n", "I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a\n", "hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that\n", "sooner or later justice will be done. Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout\n", "the short remainder of your lives! And above all, pass on this message of mine to\n", "those who come after you, so that future generations shall carry on the struggle\n", "until it is victorious.\n", "    \u2018And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument\n", "must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals\n", "have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the\n", "others. It is all lies. Man serves the interests of no creature except himself.\n", "And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the\n", "struggle. All men are enemies. All animals are comrades.\u2019\n", "    At this moment there was a tremendous uproar.

I propose this question to the meeting: Are rats comrades?\u2019\n", "    The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority\n", "that rats were comrades.

Even when\n", "you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. No animal must ever live in\n", "a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco,\n", "or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil.

Many\n", "years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing\n", "an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words.

I will\n", "sing you that song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when\n", "I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called\n", "    Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice\n", "was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something\n", "between Clementine and La Cucaracha. The words ran:\n", "     Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,\n", "     Beasts of every land and clime,\n", "     Hearken to my joyful tidings\n", "     Of the golden future time.\n", "     Soon or late the day is coming,\n", "     Tyrant Man shall be o\u2019erthrown,\n", "     And the fruitful fields of England\n", "     Shall be trod by beasts alone.\n", "     Rings shall vanish from our noses,\n", "     And the harness from our back,\n", "     Bit and spur shall rust forever,\n", "     Cruel whips no more shall crack.\n", "     Riches more than mind can picture,\n", "     Wheat and barley, oats and hay,\n", "     Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels\n", "     Shall be ours upon that day.\n", "     Bright will shine the fields of England,\n", "     Purer shall its waters be,\n", "     Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes\n", "     On the day that sets us free.\n", "     For that day we all must labour,\n", "     Though we die before it break;\n", "                                          4\n", "\f     Cows and horses, geese and turkeys,\n", "     All must toil for freedom\u2019s sake.\n", "     Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,\n", "     Beasts of every land and clime,\n", "     Hearken well and spread my tidings\n", "     Of the golden future time.\n", "     The singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement.\n", "Almost before Major had reached the end, they had begun singing it for them-\n", "selves. Even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune and a few of\n", "the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs, they had the\n", "entire song by heart within a few minutes. And then, after a few preliminary\n", "tries, the whole farm burst out into Beasts of England in tremendous unison.\n", "The cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it, the horses whinnied\n", "it, the ducks quacked it. They were so delighted with the song that they sang\n", "it right through five times in succession, and might have continued singing it all\n", "night if they had not been interrupted.\n", "     Unfortunately, the uproar awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out of bed, making\n", "sure that there was a fox in the yard. He seized the gun which always stood in a\n", "corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness.\n", "The pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the meeting broke\n", "up hurriedly. Everyone fled to his own sleeping-place. The birds jumped on to\n", "their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the whole farm was\n", "                                        5\n", "Three nights later old Major died peacefully in his sleep. His body was buried\n", "at the foot of the orchard.\n", "    This was early in March. During the next three months there was much\n", "secret activity. Major\u2019s speech had given to the more intelligent animals on the\n", "farm a completely new outlook on life. They did not know when the Rebellion\n", "predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that\n", "it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their\n", "duty to prepare for it. The work of teaching and organising the others fell\n", "naturally upon the pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of\n", "the animals. Pre-eminent among the pigs were two young boars named Snowball\n", "and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale. Napoleon was a large,\n", "rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much\n", "of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was a more\n", "vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was\n", "not considered to have the same depth of character. All the other male pigs\n", "on the farm were porkers. The best known among them was a small fat pig\n", "named Squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements,\n", "and a shrill voice. He was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some\n", "difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail\n", "which was somehow very persuasive. The others said of Squealer that he could\n", "turn black into white.\n", "    These three had elaborated old Major\u2019s teachings into a complete system of\n", "thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism. Several nights a week, after\n", "Mr. Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn and expounded the\n", "principles of Animalism to the others. At the beginning they met with much\n", "stupidity and apathy. Some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to Mr.\n", "Jones, whom they referred to as \u2018Master,\u2019 or made elementary remarks such as\n", "\u2018Mr. Jones feeds us. If he were gone, we should starve to death.\u2019 Others asked\n", "such questions as \u2018Why should we care what happens after we are dead?\u2019 or \u2018If\n", "this Rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we\n", "work for it or not?\u2019, and the pigs had great difficulty in making them see that\n", "this was contrary to the spirit of Animalism. The stupidest questions of all were\n", "asked by Mollie, the white mare. The very first question she asked Snowball\n", "was: \u2018Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion? \u2019\n", "    \u2018No,\u2019 said Snowball firmly. \u2018We have no means of making sugar on this farm.\n", "Besides, you do not need sugar. You will have all the oats and hay you want.\u2019\n", "    \u2018And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?\u2019 asked Mollie.\n", "    \u2018Comrade,\u2019 said Snowball, \u2018those ribbons that you are so devoted to are\n", "the badge of slavery. Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than\n", "                                       6\n", "    Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.\n", "    The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by\n", "Moses, the tame raven. Moses, who was Mr. Jones\u2019s especial pet, was a spy\n", "and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. He claimed to know of the\n", "existence of a mysterious country called Sugarcandy Mountain, to which all\n", "animals went when they died. It was situated somewhere up in the sky, a little\n", "distance beyond the clouds, Moses said. In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday\n", "seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and\n", "linseed cake grew on the hedges. The animals hated Moses because he told tales\n", "and did no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the\n", "pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place.\n", "    Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover.\n", "These two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves, but\n", "having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed everything that\n", "they were told, and passed it on to the other animals by simple arguments.\n", "They were unfailing in their attendance at the secret meetings in the barn, and\n", "led the singing of Beasts of England, with which the meetings always ended.\n", "    Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more\n", "easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard\n", "master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. He\n", "had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit, and had taken\n", "to drinking more than was good for him. For whole days at a time he would\n", "lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers, drinking,\n", "and occasionally feeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer. His men were\n", "idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing,\n", "the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.\n", "    June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On Midsummer\u2019s Eve,\n", "which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk at\n", "the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had\n", "milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without\n", "bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went\n", "to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of the World over his face,\n", "so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last they could\n", "stand it no longer. One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with\n", "her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. It was\n", "just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men\n", "were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions.\n", "This was more than the hungry animals could bear. With one accord, though\n", "nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon\n", "their tormentors. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted\n", "and kicked from all sides. The situation was quite out of their control. They\n", "had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of\n", "creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose,\n", "frightened them almost out of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave\n", "up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five\n", "of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with\n", "the animals pursuing them in triumph.\n", "    Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening,\n", "hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm\n", "                                       7\n", "\fby another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking\n", "loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the\n", "road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost before\n", "they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried\n", "through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.\n", "    For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good\n", "fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries\n", "of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding\n", "anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the\n", "last traces of Jones\u2019s hated reign. The harness-room at the end of the stables\n", "was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives with\n", "which Mr. Jones had been used to castrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung\n", "down the well. The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags,\n", "were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the\n", "whips. All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in\n", "flames. Snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses\u2019\n", "manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.\n", "    \u2018Ribbons,\u2019 he said, \u2018should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of\n", "a human being. All animals should go naked.\u2019\n", "    When Boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in\n", "summer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with the rest.\n", "    In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded\n", "them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon then led them back to the store-shed and served\n", "out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. Then\n", "they sang Beasts of England from end to end seven times running, and after\n", "that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.\n", "    But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious\n", "thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together. A little\n", "way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view of most of\n", "the farm. The animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the\n", "clear morning light. Yes, it was theirs \u2014 everything that they could see was\n", "theirs! In the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round, they\n", "hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement.They rolled in the\n", "dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass, they kicked up clods of\n", "the black earth and snuffed its rich scent. Then they made a tour of inspection\n", "of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the\n", "hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. It was as though they had never\n", "seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all\n", "    Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside\n", "the door of the farmhouse. That was theirs too, but they were frightened to\n", "go inside. After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted the door\n", "open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file, walking with\n", "the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything. They tiptoed from room to\n", "room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the\n", "unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feather mattresses, the looking-\n", "glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet, the lithograph of Queen Victoria\n", "over the drawing-room mantelpiece. They were lust coming down the stairs\n", "when Mollie was discovered to be missing. Going back, the others found that she\n", "had remained behind in the best bedroom. She had taken a piece of blue ribbon\n", "                                         8\n", "\ffrom Mrs. Jones\u2019s dressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and\n", "admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner. The others reproached\n", "her sharply, and they went outside. Some hams hanging in the kitchen were\n", "taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in with\n", "a kick from Boxer\u2019s hoof, \u2014 otherwise nothing in the house was touched. A\n", "unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be\n", "preserved as a museum. All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.\n", "    The animals had their breakfast, and then Snowball and Napoleon called\n", "them together again.\n", "    \u2018Comrades,\u2019 said Snowball, \u2018it is half-past six and we have a long day before\n", "us. Today we begin the hay harvest.

Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.\n", "  2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.\n", "  3. No animal shall wear clothes.\n", "  4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.\n", "  5. No animal shall drink alcohol.\n", "  6. No animal shall kill any other animal.\n", "  7. All animals are equal.\n", "   It was very neatly written, and except that \u2018friend\u2019 was written \u2018freind\u2019 and\n", "one of the \u2018S\u2019s\u2019 was the wrong way round, the spelling was correct all the way\n", "through. Snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others. All the animals\n", "nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at once began to learn the\n", "Commandments by heart.\n", "                                         9\n", "\f    \u2018Now, comrades,\u2019 cried Snowball, throwing down the paint-brush, \u2018to the\n", "hayfield! Let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more quickly\n", "than Jones and his men could do.\u2019\n", "    But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for some time\n", "past, set up a loud lowing. They had not been milked for twenty-four hours,\n", "and their udders were almost bursting. After a little thought, the pigs sent for\n", "buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully, their trotters being well adapted\n", "to this task. Soon there were five buckets of frothing creamy milk at which many\n", "of the animals looked with considerable interest.\n", "    \u2018What is going to happen to all that milk?\u2019 said someone.\n", "    \u2018Jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash,\u2019 said one of the hens.\n", "    \u2018Never mind the milk, comrades!\u2019 cried Napoleon, placing himself in front\n", "of the buckets. \u2018That will be attended to. The harvest is more important.\n", "Comrade Snowball will lead the way. I shall follow in a few minutes. Forward,\n", "comrades! The hay is waiting.\u2019\n", "    So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when\n", "they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.\n", "                                       10\n", "How they toiled and sweated to get the hay in! But their efforts were rewarded,\n", "for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped.\n", "    Sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for human\n", "beings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no animal was\n", "able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs. But the pigs were\n", "so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty. As for the horses,\n", "they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood the business of mowing\n", "and raking far better than Jones and his men had ever done. The pigs did not\n", "actually work, but directed and supervised the others. With their superior\n", "knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership. Boxer and\n", "Clover would harness themselves to the cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins\n", "were needed in these days, of course) and tramp steadily round and round the\n", "field with a pig walking behind and calling out \u2018Gee up, comrade!\u2019 or \u2018Whoa\n", "back, comrade!\u2019 as the case might be. And every animal down to the humblest\n", "worked at turning the hay and gathering it. Even the ducks and hens toiled to\n", "and fro all day in the sun, carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks. In the end\n", "they finished the harvest in two days\u2019 less time than it had usually taken Jones\n", "and his men. Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen.\n", "There was no wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had\n", "gathered up the very last stalk. And not an animal on the farm had stolen so\n", "    All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. The an-\n", "imals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. Every mouthful\n", "of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food,\n", "produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging\n", "master. With the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for\n", "everyone to eat. There was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals\n", "were. They met with many difficulties \u2014 for instance, later in the year, when\n", "they harvested the corn, they had to tread it out in the ancient style and blow\n", "away the chaff with their breath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine\n", "\u2014 but the pigs with their cleverness and Boxer with his tremendous muscles\n", "always pulled them through. Boxer was the admiration of everybody. He had\n", "been a hard worker even in Jones\u2019s time, but now he seemed more like three\n", "horses than one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest\n", "on his mighty shoulders. From morning to night he was pushing and pulling,\n", "always at the spot where the work was hardest. He had made an arrangement\n", "with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than\n", "anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be\n", "most needed, before the regular day\u2019s work began.

The hens and ducks, for\n", "instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the stray\n", "grains. Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the quarrelling and\n", "biting and jealousy which had been normal features of life in the old days had\n", "almost disappeared. Nobody shirked \u2014 or almost nobody. Mollie, it was true,\n", "was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a way of leaving work early\n", "on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof. And the behaviour of the\n", "cat was somewhat peculiar. It was soon noticed that when there was work to\n", "be done the cat could never be found. She would vanish for hours on end, and\n", "then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though\n", "nothing had happened. But she always made such excellent excuses, and purred\n", "so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.\n", "Old Benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the Rebellion. He did\n", "his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in Jones\u2019s time, never\n", "shirking and never volunteering for extra work either. About the Rebellion and\n", "its results he would express no opinion. When asked whether he was not happier\n", "now that Jones was gone, he would say only \u2018Donkeys live a long time. None\n", "of you has ever seen a dead donkey,\u2019 and the others had to be content with this\n", "    On Sundays there was no work. Breakfast was an hour later than usual, and\n", "after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without\n", "fail. First came the hoisting of the flag. Snowball had found in the harness-room\n", "an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones\u2019s and had painted on it a hoof and a horn\n", "in white. This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every Sunday 8,\n", "morning. The flag was green, Snowball explained, to represent the green fields of\n", "England, while the hoof and horn signified the future Republic of the Animals\n", "which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown. After\n", "the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the big barn for a general\n", "assembly which was known as the Meeting. Here the work of the coming week\n", "was planned out and resolutions were put forward and debated. It was always\n", "the pigs who put forward the resolutions. The other animals understood how\n", "to vote, but could never think of any resolutions of their own. Snowball and\n", "Napoleon were by far the most active in the debates. But it was noticed that\n", "these two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made,\n", "the other could be counted on to oppose it. Even when it was resolved \u2014 a thing\n", "no one could object to in itself \u2014 to set aside the small paddock behind the\n", "orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was a stormy\n", "debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal. The Meeting always\n", "ended with the singing of Beasts of England, and the afternoon was given up to\n", "    The pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for themselves.\n", "Here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and other nec-\n", "essary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse. Snowball\n", "also busied himself with organising the other animals into what he called Ani-\n", "mal Committees. He was indefatigable at this. He formed the Egg Production\n", "Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows, the Wild Com-\n", "rades\u2019 Re-education Committee (the object of this was to tame the rats and\n", "rabbits), the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, and various others, besides\n", "                                       12\n", "\finstituting classes in reading and writing. On the whole, these projects were\n", "a failure. The attempt to tame the wild creatures, for instance, broke down\n", "almost immediately. They continued to behave very much as before, and when\n", "treated with generosity, simply took advantage of it. The cat joined the Re-\n", "education Committee and was very active in it for some days. She was seen\n", "one day sitting on a roof and talking to some sparrows who were just out of her\n", "reach. She was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any\n", "sparrow who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept\n", "    The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. By the\n", "autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.\n", "    As for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly. The dogs\n", "learned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anything except\n", "the Seven Commandments. Muriel, the goat, could read somewhat better than\n", "the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the evenings from scraps\n", "of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap. Benjamin could read as\n", "well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty. So far as he knew, he said, there\n", "was nothing worth reading. Clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not\n", "put words together. Boxer could not get beyond the letter D. He would trace\n", "out A, B, C, D, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring\n", "at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with\n", "all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding. On several\n", "occasions, indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H, but by the time he knew them, it was\n", "always discovered that he had forgotten A, B, C, and D. Finally he decided to\n", "be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once or twice\n", "every day to refresh his memory. Mollie refused to learn any but the six letters\n", "which spelt her own name. She would form these very neatly out of pieces of\n", "twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or two and walk round them\n", "    None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A.\n", "It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks,\n", "were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart. After much thought\n", "Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be reduced to\n", "a single maxim, namely: \u2018Four legs good, two legs bad.\u2019 This, he said, contained\n", "the essential principle of Animalism. Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would\n", "be safe from human influences. The birds at first objected, since it seemed to\n", "them that they also had two legs, but Snowball proved to them that this was\n", "    \u2018A bird\u2019s wing, comrades,\u2019 he said, \u2018is an organ of propulsion and not of\n", "manipulation. It should therefore be regarded as a leg.

FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD, was inscribed on the end\n", "wall of the barn, above the Seven Commandments and in bigger letters When\n", "they had once got it by heart, the sheep developed a great liking for this maxim,\n", "and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating \u2018Four legs good,\n", "two legs bad! Four legs good, two legs bad!\u2019 and keep it up for hours on end,\n", "never growing tired of it.\n", "    Napoleon took no interest in Snowball\u2019s committees. He said that the edu-\n", "                                        13\n", "\fcation of the young was more important than anything that could be done for\n", "those who were already grown up. It happened that Jessie and Bluebell had\n", "both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them to nine\n", "sturdy puppies. As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them away from\n", "their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible for their educa-\n", "tion.

It was mixed\n", "every day into the pigs\u2019 mash. The early apples were now ripening, and the grass\n", "of the orchard was littered with windfalls. The animals had assumed as a matter\n", "of course that these would be shared out equally; one day, however, the order\n", "went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-\n", "room for the use of the pigs. At this some of the other animals murmured, but\n", "it was no use. All the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even Snowball\n", "and Napoleon.

Many of us actually dislike milk\n", "and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is\n", "to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science,\n", "comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig.\n", "We pigs are brainworkers.

When it was put to them in this light,\n", "they had no more to say. The importance of keeping the pigs in good health\n", "was all too obvious. So it was agreed without further argument that the milk\n", "and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples when they ripened)\n", "should be reserved for the pigs alone.\n", "                                       14\n", "By the late summer the news of what had happened on Animal Farm had spread\n", "across half the county.

The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did\n", "not at first give him much help. At heart, each of them was secretly wondering\n", "whether he could not somehow turn Jones\u2019s misfortune to his own advantage.\n", "It was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm\n", "were on permanently bad terms. One of them, which was named Foxwood, was\n", "a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all\n", "its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition. Its owner, Mr.\n", "Pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in\n", "fishing or hunting according to the season. The other farm, which was called\n", "Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept. Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough,\n", "shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard\n", "bargains. These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them\n", "to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.\n", "    Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on An-\n", "imal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too\n", "much about it. At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals\n", "managing a farm for themselves. The whole thing would be over in a fortnight,\n", "they said. They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm (they insisted\n", "on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not tolerate the name \u2018Animal Farm\u2019)\n", "were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to\n", "death. When time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death,\n", "Frederick and Pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible\n", "wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm. It was given out that the ani-\n", "mals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes,\n", "and had their females in common. This was what came of rebelling against the\n", "laws of Nature, Frederick and Pilkington said.\n", "    However, these stories were never fully believed.

Above all, the tune and\n", "even the words of Beasts of England were known everywhere. It had spread\n", "with astonishing speed. The human beings could not contain their rage when\n", "they heard this song, though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous. They\n", "could not understand, they said, how even animals could bring themselves to\n", "sing such contemptible rubbish. Any animal caught singing it was given a flog-\n", "ging on the spot. And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled\n", "it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the\n", "smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings listened\n", "to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.\n", "    Early in October, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was\n", "already threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and alighted\n", "in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement. Jones and all his men,\n", "with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield, had entered the five-\n", "barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to the farm. They were\n", "all carrying sticks, except Jones, who was marching ahead with a gun in his\n", "hands. Obviously they were going to attempt the recapture of the farm.\n", "    This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made. Snowball,\n", "who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar\u2019s campaigns which he had found\n", "in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations. He gave his orders\n", "quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post.\n", "    As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his\n", "first attack. All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over\n", "the men\u2019s heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were\n", "dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out\n", "and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs. However, this was only a light\n", "skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily\n", "drove the geese off with their sticks. Snowball now launched his second line\n", "of attack. Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the head of\n", "them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from every side, while\n", "Benjamin turned around and lashed at them with his small hoofs. But once\n", "again the men, with their sticks and their hobnailed boots, were too strong for\n", "them; and suddenly, at a squeal from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat,\n", "all the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.\n", "    The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their enemies\n", "in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. This was just what Snowball\n", "had intended. As soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses,\n", "the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying in ambush in\n", "the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off. Snowball now\n", "gave the signal for the charge. He himself dashed straight for Jones. Jones\n", "saw him coming, raised his gun and fired. The pellets scored bloody streaks\n", "along Snowball\u2019s back, and a sheep dropped dead. Without halting for an\n", "instant, Snowball flung his fifteen stone against Jones\u2019s legs. Jones was hurled\n", "into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of his hands. But the most terrifying\n", "spectacle of all was Boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his\n", "great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion. His very first blow took a stable-lad from\n", "Foxwood on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud. At the sight, several\n", "men dropped their sticks and tried to run. Panic overtook them, and the next\n", "moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round the yard.\n", "                                       16\n", "\fThey were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on. There was not an animal on the\n", "farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. Even the cat\n", "suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman\u2019s shoulders and sank her claws in his\n", "neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment when the opening was clear,\n", "the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main\n", "road. And so within five minutes of their invasion they were in ignominious\n", "retreat by the same way as they had come, with a flock of geese hissing after\n", "them and pecking at their calves all the way.\n", "    All the men were gone except one. Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with\n", "his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him\n", "over. The boy did not stir.\n", "    \u2018He is dead,\u2019 said Boxer sorrowfully. \u2018I had no intention of doing that. I\n", "forgot that I was wearing iron shoes. Who will believe that I did not do this on\n", "    \u2018No sentimentality, comrade!\u2019 cried Snowball from whose wounds the blood\n", "was still dripping. \u2018War is war. The only good human being is a dead one.\u2019\n", "    \u2018I have no wish to take life, not even human life,\u2019 repeated Boxer, and his\n", "eyes were full of tears.\n", "    \u2018Where is Mollie?\u2019 exclaimed somebody.\n", "    Mollie in fact was missing. For a moment there was great alarm; it was\n", "feared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even carried her\n", "off with them. In the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall with her\n", "head buried among the hay in the manger. She had taken to flight as soon as\n", "the gun went off.

An impromptu celebration\n", "of the victory was held immediately. The flag was run up and Beasts of England\n", "was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had been killed was given a\n", "solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her grave. At the graveside\n", "Snowball made a little speech, emphasising the need for all animals to be ready\n", "to die for Animal Farm if need be.\n", "    The animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, \u2018Animal\n", "Hero, First Class,\u2019 which was conferred there and then on Snowball and Boxer.\n", "It consisted of a brass medal (they were really some old horse-brasses which had\n", "been found in the harness-room), to be worn on Sundays and holidays.

One day, as Mollie\n", "strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her long tail and chewing at a stalk of\n", "hay, Clover took her aside.\n", "    \u2018Mollie,\u2019 she said, \u2018I have something very serious to say to you. This morning\n", "I saw you looking over the hedge that divides Animal Farm from Foxwood. One\n", "of Mr. Pilkington\u2019s men was standing on the other side of the hedge. And \u2014\n", "I was a long way away, but I am almost certain I saw this \u2014 he was talking\n", "to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose. What does that mean,\n", "    \u2018He didn\u2019t! I wasn\u2019t! It isn\u2019t true!\u2019 cried Mollie, beginning to prance about\n", "    \u2018Mollie! Look me in the face. Do you give me your word of honour that that\n", "man was not stroking your nose?\u2019\n", "    \u2018It isn\u2019t true!\u2019 repeated Mollie, but she could not look Clover in the face,\n", "and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field.\n", "    A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others, she went\n", "to Mollie\u2019s stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. Hidden under the\n", "straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different\n", "    Three days later Mollie disappeared. For some weeks nothing was known of\n", "her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the other\n", "side of Willingdon. She was between the shafts of a smart dogcart painted red\n", "and black, which was standing outside a public-house. A fat red-faced man in\n", "check breeches and gaiters, who looked like a publican, was stroking her nose\n", "and feeding her with sugar. Her coat was newly clipped and she wore a scarlet\n", "ribbon round her forelock. She appeared to be enjoying herself, so the pigeons\n", "said. None of the animals ever mentioned Mollie again.\n", "    In January there came bitterly hard weather. The earth was like iron, and\n", "nothing could be done in the fields. Many meetings were held in the big barn,\n", "and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the coming\n", "season. It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer\n", "than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their\n", "decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote. This arrangement would have\n", "worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between Snowball and\n", "                                       18\n", "\fNapoleon. These two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible.\n", "If one of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was\n", "certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that such\n", "and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was\n", "useless for anything except roots. Each had his own following, and there were\n", "some violent debates. At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority\n", "by his brilliant speeches, but Napoleon was better at canvassing support for\n", "himself in between times. He was especially successful with the sheep. Of late\n", "the sheep had taken to bleating \u2018Four legs good, two legs bad\u2019 both in and out\n", "of season, and they often interrupted the Meeting with this. It was noticed that\n", "they were especially liable to break into \u2018Four legs good, two legs bad\u2019 at crucial\n", "moments in Snowball\u2019s speeches. Snowball had made a close study of some back\n", "numbers of the Farmer and Stockbreeder which he had found in the farmhouse,\n", "and was full of plans for innovations and improvements. He talked learnedly\n", "about field drains, silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated\n", "scheme for all the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different\n", "spot every day, to save the labour of cartage. Napoleon produced no schemes of\n", "his own, but said quietly that Snowball\u2019s would come to nothing, and seemed\n", "to be biding his time. But of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the\n", "one that took place over the windmill.\n", "    In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll\n", "which was the highest point on the farm. After surveying the ground, Snowball\n", "declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which could be made to\n", "operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power. This would light\n", "the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-\n", "cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking machine. The animals had never\n", "heard of anything of this kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned one\n", "and had only the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment\n", "while Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their\n", "work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their\n", "minds with reading and conversation.\n", "    Within a few weeks Snowball\u2019s plans for the windmill were fully worked out.\n", "The mechanical details came mostly from three books which had belonged to\n", "Mr. Jones \u2014 One Thousand Useful Things to Do About the House, Every Man\n", "His Own Bricklayer, and Electricity for Beginners. Snowball used as his study\n", "a shed which had once been used for incubators and had a smooth wooden\n", "floor, suitable for drawing on. He was closeted there for hours at a time. With\n", "his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the\n", "knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after\n", "line and uttering little whimpers of excitement. Gradually the plans grew into\n", "a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor,\n", "which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive.\n", "All of them came to look at Snowball\u2019s drawings at least once a day. Even the\n", "hens and ducks came, and were at pains not to tread on the chalk marks. Only\n", "Napoleon held aloof. He had declared himself against the windmill from the\n", "start. One day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans. He\n", "walked heavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and\n", "snuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplating them\n", "out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the\n", "plans, and walked out without uttering a word.\n", "                                        19\n", "\f    The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill. Snowball\n", "did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business. Stone would have\n", "to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have to be made\n", "and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables. (How these were\n", "to be procured, Snowball did not say.) But he maintained that it could all be\n", "done in a year. And thereafter, he declared, so much labour would be saved\n", "that the animals would only need to work three days a week. Napoleon, on\n", "the other hand, argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food\n", "production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve\n", "to death. The animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogan,\n", "\u2018Vote for Snowball and the three-day week\u2019 and \u2018Vote for Napoleon and the full\n", "manger.\u2019 Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction.\n", "He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the\n", "windmill would save work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on\n", "as it had always gone on \u2014 that is, badly.\n", "    Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the\n", "defence of the farm. It was fully realised that though the human beings had\n", "been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed they might make another and more\n", "determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate Mr. Jones. They had\n", "all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread\n", "across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more\n", "restive than ever. As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement.\n", "According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure firearms and\n", "train themselves in the use of them. According to Snowball, they must send\n", "out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the\n", "other farms. The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were\n", "bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere\n", "they would have no need to defend themselves. The animals listened first to\n", "Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was\n", "right; indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was\n", "speaking at the moment.\n", "    At last the day came when Snowball\u2019s plans were completed. At the Meeting\n", "on the following Sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the\n", "windmill was to be put to the vote. When the animals had assembled in the\n", "big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by bleating\n", "from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill.\n", "Then Napoleon stood up to reply. He said very quietly that the windmill was\n", "nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down\n", "again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent\n", "as to the effect he produced. At this Snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting\n", "down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal\n", "in favour of the windmill. Until now the animals had been about equally divided\n", "in their sympathies, but in a moment Snowball\u2019s eloquence had carried them\n", "away. In glowing sentences he painted a picture of Animal Farm as it might\n", "be when sordid labour was lifted from the animals\u2019 backs. His imagination had\n", "now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. Electricity, he said, could\n", "operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders,\n", "besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and\n", "an electric heater. By the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt\n", "as to which way the vote would go. But just at this moment Napoleon stood\n", "                                       20\n", "\fup and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball, uttered a high-pitched\n", "whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before.\n", "    At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs\n", "wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. They dashed\n", "straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape\n", "their snapping jaws. In a moment he was out of the door and they were after\n", "him. Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through the\n", "door to watch the chase. Snowball was racing across the long pasture that led\n", "to the road. He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on\n", "his heels. Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. Then\n", "he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him\n", "again. One of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball\u2019s tail, but Snowball\n", "whisked it free just in time. Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few\n", "inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.\n", "    Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. In a moment the\n", "dogs came bounding back. At first no one had been able to imagine where these\n", "creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they were the pup-\n", "pies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately.\n", "Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves.\n", "They kept close to Napoleon. It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him\n", "in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr. Jones.\n", "    Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised por-\n", "tion of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver his speech. He\n", "announced that from now on the Sunday-morning Meetings would come to an\n", "end. They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time. In future all questions\n", "relating to the working of the farm would be settled by a special committee\n", "of pigs, presided over by himself. These would meet in private and afterwards\n", "communicate their decisions to the others. The animals would still assemble on\n", "Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing Beasts of England, and receive their\n", "orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.\n", "    In spite of the shock that Snowball\u2019s expulsion had given them, the animals\n", "were dismayed by this announcement. Several of them would have protested if\n", "they could have found the right arguments. Even Boxer was vaguely troubled.\n", "He set his ears back, shook his forelock several times, and tried hard to marshal\n", "his thoughts; but in the end he could not think of anything to say. Some of\n", "the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate. Four young porkers in the\n", "front row uttered shrill squeals of disapproval, and all four of them sprang to\n", "their feet and began speaking at once. But suddenly the dogs sitting round\n", "Napoleon let out deep, menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down\n", "again. Then the sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of \u2018Four legs good,\n", "two legs bad!\u2019 which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to\n", "any chance of discussion.\n", "    Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangement\n", "    \u2018Comrades,\u2019 he said, \u2018I trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice\n", "that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself.\n", "Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the contrary, it\n", "is a deep and heavy responsibility. No one believes more firmly than Comrade\n", "Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only too happy to let you\n", "make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong\n", "                                       21\n", "\fdecisions, comrades, and then where should we be? Suppose you had decided\n", "to follow Snowball, with his moonshine of windmills \u2014 Snowball, who, as we\n", "now know, was no better than a criminal?\u2019\n", "    \u2018He fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed,\u2019 said somebody.\n", "    \u2018Bravery is not enough,\u2019 said Squealer. \u2018Loyalty and obedience are more\n", "important. And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time will come\n", "when we shall find that Snowball\u2019s part in it was much exaggerated. Discipline,\n", "comrades, iron discipline! That is the watchword for today. One false step, and\n", "our enemies would be upon us. Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?\u2019\n", "    Once again this argument was unanswerable. Certainly the animals did not\n", "want Jones back; if the holding of debates on Sunday mornings was liable to\n", "bring him back, then the debates must stop. Boxer, who had now had time to\n", "think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying: \u2018If Comrade Napoleon\n", "says it, it must be right.\u2019 And from then on he adopted the maxim, \u2018Napoleon\n", "is always right,\u2019 in addition to his private motto of \u2018I will work harder.\u2019\n", "    By this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun.\n", "The shed where Snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut\n", "up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor. Every\n", "Sunday morning at ten o\u2019clock the animals assembled in the big barn to receive\n", "their orders for the week. The skull of old Major, now clean of flesh, had been\n", "disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff,\n", "beside the gun. After the hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file\n", "past the skull in a reverent manner before entering the barn. Nowadays they did\n", "not sit all together as they had done in the past. Napoleon, with Squealer and\n", "another pig named Minimus, who had a remarkable gift for composing songs\n", "and poems, sat on the front of the raised platform, with the nine young dogs\n", "forming a semicircle round them, and the other pigs sitting behind. The rest of\n", "the animals sat facing them in the main body of the barn. Napoleon read out\n", "the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of\n", "Beasts of England, all the animals dispersed.\n", "    On the third Sunday after Snowball\u2019s expulsion, the animals were somewhat\n", "surprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built after\n", "all. He did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but merely warned\n", "the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work, it might even be\n", "necessary to reduce their rations. The plans, however, had all been prepared,\n", "down to the last detail. A special committee of pigs had been at work upon\n", "them for the past three weeks. The building of the windmill, with various other\n", "improvements, was expected to take two years.\n", "    That evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals that Napoleon\n", "had never in reality been opposed to the windmill. On the contrary, it was\n", "he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan which Snowball had\n", "drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually been stolen from among\n", "Napoleon\u2019s papers. The windmill was, in fact, Napoleon\u2019s own creation. Why,\n", "then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against it? Here Squealer\n", "looked very sly. That, he said, was Comrade Napoleon\u2019s cunning. He had\n", "seemed to oppose the windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get rid of Snow-\n", "ball, who was a dangerous character and a bad influence. Now that Snowball\n", "was out of the way, the plan could go forward without his interference. This,\n", "said Squealer, was something called tactics. He repeated a number of times,\n", "\u2018Tactics, comrades, tactics!\u2019 skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry\n", "                                       22\n", "\flaugh. The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke\n", "so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so\n", "threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.\n", "                                    23\n", "All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work;\n", "they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was\n", "for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them,\n", "and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.\n", "    Throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and in\n", "August Napoleon announced that there would be work on Sunday afternoons\n", "as well. This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself\n", "from it would have his rations reduced by half. Even so, it was found necessary\n", "to leave certain tasks undone. The harvest was a little less successful than in\n", "the previous year, and two fields which should have been sown with roots in\n", "the early summer were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed\n", "early enough. It was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a hard\n", "    The windmill presented unexpected difficulties. There was a good quarry of\n", "limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in one\n", "of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand. But the\n", "problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up the stone into\n", "pieces of suitable size. There seemed no way of doing this except with picks and\n", "crowbars, which no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind\n", "legs. Only after weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody \u2014\n", "namely, to utilise the force of gravity. Huge boulders, far too big to be used as\n", "they were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry. The animals lashed ropes\n", "round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could\n", "lay hold of the rope \u2014 even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments \u2014\n", "they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry,\n", "where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below. Transporting\n", "the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple. The horses carried\n", "it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel and Benjamin\n", "yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. By late summer\n", "a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the building began, under\n", "the superintendence of the pigs.\n", "    But it was a slow, laborious process. Frequently it took a whole day of\n", "exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, and sometimes\n", "when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break. Nothing could have been\n", "achieved without Boxer, whose strength seemed equal to that of all the rest of\n", "the animals put together. When the boulder began to slip and the animals cried\n", "out in despair at finding themselves dragged down the hill, it was always Boxer\n", "who strained himself against the rope and brought the boulder to a stop. To\n", "see him toiling up the slope inch by inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of\n", "                                       24\n", "\fhis hoofs clawing at the ground, and his great sides matted with sweat, filled\n", "everyone with admiration. Clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to\n", "overstrain himself, but Boxer would never listen to her. His two slogans, \u2018I will\n", "work harder\u2019 and \u2018Napoleon is always right,\u2019 seemed to him a sufficient answer\n", "to all problems. He had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him three-\n", "quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour. And in his\n", "spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would go alone to\n", "the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down to the site of the\n", "windmill unassisted.\n", "     The animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of the\n", "hardness of their work. If they had no more food than they had had in Jones\u2019s\n", "day, at least they did not have less. The advantage of only having to feed\n", "themselves, and not having to support five extravagant human beings as well,\n", "was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures to outweigh it. And in\n", "many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved\n", "labour. Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness\n", "impossible to human beings. And again, since no animal now stole, it was\n", "unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land, which saved a lot of labour\n", "on the upkeep of hedges and gates. Nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various\n", "unforeseen shortages began to make them selves felt. There was need of paraffin\n", "oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron for the horses\u2019 shoes, none of which could\n", "be produced on the farm. Later there would also be need for seeds and artificial\n", "manures, besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for the windmill. How\n", "these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine.\n", "     One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders,\n", "Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy. From now on-\n", "wards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of\n", "course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain ma-\n", "terials which were urgently necessary. The needs of the windmill must override\n", "everything else, he said. He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of\n", "hay and part of the current year\u2019s wheat crop, and later on, if more money were\n", "needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was\n", "always a market in Willingdon. The hens, said Napoleon, should welcome this\n", "sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill.\n", "     Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. Never to have\n", "any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of\n", "money \u2014 had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first\n", "triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled? All the animals remembered\n", "passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they remembered it.\n", "The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleon abolished the Meetings\n", "raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous\n", "growling from the dogs. Then, as usual, the sheep broke into \u2018Four legs good,\n", "two legs bad!\u2019 and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over. Finally\n", "Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he had already made\n", "all the arrangements. There would be no need for any of the animals to come\n", "in contact with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable. He\n", "intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders. A Mr. Whymper, a\n", "solicitor living in Willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal\n", "Farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to\n", "receive his instructions. Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of \u2018Long\n", "                                         25\n", "\flive Animal Farm!\u2019 and after the singing of Beasts of England the animals were\n", "    Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals\u2019 minds\n", "at rest. He assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and\n", "using money had never been passed, or even suggested. It was pure imagina-\n", "tion, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by Snowball. A few\n", "animals still felt faintly doubtful, but Squealer asked them shrewdly, \u2018Are you\n", "certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades? Have you\n", "any record of such a resolution? Is it written down anywhere?\u2019 And since it\n", "was certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in writing, the animals were\n", "satisfied that they had been mistaken.\n", "    Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited the farm as had been arranged. He\n", "was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way\n", "of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than anyone else that\n", "Animal Farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be worth\n", "having. The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and\n", "avoided him as much as possible. Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on all\n", "fours, delivering orders to Whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride\n", "and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement. Their relations with the\n", "human race were now not quite the same as they had been before. The human\n", "beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed,\n", "they hated it more than ever. Every human being held it as an article of\n", "faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the\n", "windmill would be a failure. They would meet in the public-houses and prove\n", "to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down,\n", "or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against\n", "their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which\n", "the animals were managing their own affairs. One symptom of this was that\n", "they had begun to call Animal Farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend\n", "that it was called the Manor Farm. They had also dropped their championship\n", "of Jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live in\n", "another part of the county. Except through Whymper, there was as yet no\n", "contact between Animal Farm and the outside world, but there were constant\n", "rumours that Napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement\n", "either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield \u2014\n", "but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.\n", "    It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and\n", "took up their residence there. Again the animals seemed to remember that a\n", "resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again Squealer was\n", "able to convince them that this was not the case. It was absolutely necessary,\n", "he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the farm, should have a quiet\n", "place to work in. It was also more suited to the dignity of the Leader (for of\n", "late he had taken to speaking of Napoleon under the title of \u2018Leader\u2019) to live in\n", "a house than in a mere sty. Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed\n", "when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and\n", "used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds. Boxer\n", "passed it off as usual with \u2018Napoleon is always right!\u2019, but Clover, who thought\n", "she remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn\n", "and tried to puzzle out the Seven Commandments which were inscribed there.\n", "Finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched Muriel.\n", "                                       26\n", "\f    \u2018Muriel,\u2019 she said, \u2018read me the Fourth Commandment. Does it not say\n", "something about never sleeping in a bed?\u2019\n", "    With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.\n", "    \u2018It says, \u2019No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,\u201d she announced finally.\n", "    Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Command-\n", "ment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so.\n", "And Squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two or\n", "three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.\n", "    \u2018You have heard then, comrades,\u2019 he said, \u2018that we pigs now sleep in the\n", "beds of the farmhouse? And why not? You did not suppose, surely, that there\n", "was ever a ruling against beds? A bed merely means a place to sleep in. A pile\n", "of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. The rule was against sheets,\n", "which are a human invention. We have removed the sheets from the farmhouse\n", "beds, and sleep between blankets. And very comfortable beds they are too!\n", "But not more comfortable than we need, I can tell you, comrades, with all the\n", "brainwork we have to do nowadays. You would not rob us of our repose, would\n", "you, comrades? You would not have us too tired to carry out our duties? Surely\n", "none of you wishes to see Jones back?\u2019\n", "    The animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was said\n", "about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds. And when, some days afterwards,\n", "it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an hour later in the\n", "mornings than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either.\n", "    By the autumn the animals were tired but happy. They had had a hard\n", "year, and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of food for the\n", "winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for everything.\n", "It was almost half built now. After the harvest there was a stretch of clear dry\n", "weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever, thinking it well worth while\n", "to plod to and fro all day with blocks of stone if by doing so they could raise the\n", "walls another foot. Boxer would even come out at nights and work for an hour\n", "or two on his own by the light of the harvest moon. In their spare moments\n", "the animals would walk round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the\n", "strength and perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever\n", "have been able to build anything so imposing. Only old Benjamin refused to\n", "grow enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as usual, he would utter nothing\n", "beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time.\n", "    November came, with raging south-west winds. Building had to stop because\n", "it was now too wet to mix the cement. Finally there came a night when the gale\n", "was so violent that the farm buildings rocked on their foundations and several\n", "tiles were blown off the roof of the barn. The hens woke up squawking with\n", "terror because they had all dreamed simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in\n", "the distance. In the morning the animals came out of their stalls to find that\n", "the flagstaff had been blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the orchard\n", "had been plucked up like a radish. They had just noticed this when a cry of\n", "despair broke from every animal\u2019s throat. A terrible sight had met their eyes.\n", "The windmill was in ruins.\n", "    With one accord they dashed down to the spot. Napoleon, who seldom\n", "moved out of a walk, raced ahead of them all. Yes, there it lay, the fruit\n", "of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had broken\n", "and carried so laboriously scattered all around. Unable at first to speak, they\n", "stood gazing mournfully at the litter of fallen stone Napoleon paced to and fro\n", "                                        27\n", "\fin silence, occasionally snuffing at the ground. His tail had grown rigid and\n", "twitched sharply from side to side, a sign in him of intense mental activity.\n", "Suddenly he halted as though his mind were made up.\n", "     \u2018Comrades,\u2019 he said quietly, \u2018do you know who is responsible for this? Do\n", "you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our windmill?\n", "SNOWBALL!\u2019 he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder. \u2018Snowball has done this\n", "thing! In sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge himself for\n", "his ignominious expulsion, this traitor has crept here under cover of night and\n", "destroyed our work of nearly a year. Comrades, here and now I pronounce the\n", "death sentence upon Snowball. \u2019Animal Hero, Second Class,\u2019 and half a bushel\n", "of apples to any animal who brings him to justice. A full bushel to anyone who\n", "captures him alive!\u2019\n", "     The animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even Snowball could\n", "be guilty of such an action. There was a cry of indignation, and everyone\n", "began thinking out ways of catching Snowball if he should ever come back.\n", "Almost immediately the footprints of a pig were discovered in the grass at a\n", "little distance from the knoll. They could only be traced for a few yards, but\n", "appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge. Napoleon snuffed deeply at them and\n", "pronounced them to be Snowball\u2019s. He gave it as his opinion that Snowball had\n", "probably come from the direction of Foxwood Farm.\n", "     \u2018No more delays, comrades!\u2019 cried Napoleon when the footprints had been\n", "examined. \u2018There is work to be done. This very morning we begin rebuilding\n", "the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain or shine. We will\n", "teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. Remember,\n", "comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to\n", "the day. Forward, comrades! Long live the windmill! Long live Animal Farm!\u2019\n", "                                      28\n", "It was a bitter winter. The stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow, and\n", "then by a hard frost which did not break till well into February. The animals\n", "carried on as best they could with the rebuilding of the windmill, well knowing\n", "that the outside world was watching them and that the envious human beings\n", "would rejoice and triumph if the mill were not finished on time.\n", "    Out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was Snowball\n", "who had destroyed the windmill: they said that it had fallen down because the\n", "walls were too thin. The animals knew that this was not the case. Still, it had\n", "been decided to build the walls three feet thick this time instead of eighteen\n", "inches as before, which meant collecting much larger quantities of stone. For a\n", "long time the quarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing could be done. Some\n", "progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work,\n", "and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. They\n", "were always cold, and usually hungry as well. Only Boxer and Clover never lost\n", "heart. Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of\n", "labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in Boxer\u2019s strength and\n", "his never-failing cry of \u2018I will work harder!\u2019\n", "    In January food fell short. The corn ration was drastically reduced, and it\n", "was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up for it.\n", "Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had been frosted\n", "in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough. The potatoes had\n", "become soft and discoloured, and only a few were edible. For days at a time the\n", "animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels. Starvation seemed to stare\n", "    It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world. Embold-\n", "ened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were inventing fresh lies\n", "about Animal Farm. Once again it was being put about that all the animals\n", "were dying of famine and disease, and that they were continually fighting among\n", "themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide. Napoleon was well\n", "aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation\n", "were known, and he decided to make use of Mr. Whymper to spread a contrary\n", "impression. Hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with Whymper\n", "on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected animals, mostly sheep, were\n", "instructed to remark casually in his hearing that rations had been increased. In\n", "addition, Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled\n", "nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained\n", "of the grain and meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the\n", "store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived, and\n", "continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on\n", "                                       29\n", "    Nevertheless, towards the end of January it became obvious that it would be\n", "necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. In these days Napoleon\n", "rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the farmhouse, which was\n", "guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs. When he did emerge, it was in a\n", "ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs who closely surrounded him and\n", "growled if anyone came too near. Frequently he did not even appear on Sunday\n", "mornings, but issued his orders through one of the other pigs, usually Squealer.\n", "    One Sunday morning Squealer announced that the hens, who had just come\n", "in to lay again, must surrender their eggs. Napoleon had accepted, through\n", "Whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. The price of these would\n", "pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on and\n", "conditions were easier.\n", "    When the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. They had been\n", "warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not believed that\n", "it would really happen. They were just getting their clutches ready for the\n", "spring sitting, and they protested that to take the eggs away now was murder.\n", "For the first time since the expulsion of Jones, there was something resembling\n", "a rebellion. Led by three young Black Minorca pullets, the hens made a deter-\n", "mined effort to thwart Napoleon\u2019s wishes. Their method was to fly up to the\n", "rafters and there lay their eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor. Napoleon\n", "acted swiftly and ruthlessly. He ordered the hens\u2019 rations to be stopped, and\n", "decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be\n", "punished by death. The dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out. For\n", "five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and went back to their nesting\n", "boxes. Nine hens had died in the meantime. Their bodies were buried in the\n", "orchard, and it was given out that they had died of coccidiosis. Whymper heard\n", "nothing of this affair, and the eggs were duly delivered, a grocer\u2019s van driving\n", "up to the farm once a week to take them away.\n", "    All this while no more had been seen of Snowball. He was rumoured to be\n", "hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either Foxwood or Pinchfield. Napoleon\n", "was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers than before. It\n", "happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which had been stacked\n", "there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared. It was well seasoned,\n", "and Whymper had advised Napoleon to sell it; both Mr. Pilkington and Mr.\n", "Frederick were anxious to buy it. Napoleon was hesitating between the two,\n", "unable to make up his mind. It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the\n", "point of coming to an agreement with Frederick, Snowball was declared to be\n", "in hiding at Foxwood, while, when he inclined toward Pilkington, Snowball was\n", "said to be at Pinchfield.\n", "    Suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered. Snowball\n", "was secretly frequenting the farm by night! The animals were so disturbed that\n", "they could hardly sleep in their stalls. Every night, it was said, he came creeping\n", "in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. He stole the corn,\n", "he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed\n", "the bark off the fruit trees. Whenever anything went wrong it became usual\n", "to attribute it to Snowball. If a window was broken or a drain was blocked\n", "up, someone was certain to say that Snowball had come in the night and done\n", "it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced\n", "that Snowball had thrown it down the well. Curiously enough, they went on\n", "                                        30\n", "\fbelieving this even after the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal. The\n", "cows declared unanimously that Snowball crept into their stalls and milked them\n", "in their sleep. The rats, which had been troublesome that winter, were also said\n", "to be in league with Snowball.\n", "    Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into Snowball\u2019s\n", "activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of\n", "inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful\n", "distance. At every few steps Napoleon stopped and snuffed the ground for\n", "traces of Snowball\u2019s footsteps, which, he said, he could detect by the smell. He\n", "snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cow-shed, in the henhouses, in the\n", "vegetable garden, and found traces of Snowball almost everywhere. He would\n", "put his snout to the ground, give several deep sniffs, ad exclaim in a terrible\n", "voice, \u2018Snowball! He has been here! I can smell him distinctly!\u2019 and at the\n", "word \u2018Snowball\u2019 all the dogs let out blood-curdling growls and showed their side\n", "    The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though Snow-\n", "ball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and\n", "menacing them with all kinds of dangers. In the evening Squealer called them\n", "together, and with an alarmed expression on his face told them that he had\n", "some serious news to report.\n", "    \u2018Comrades!\u2019 cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, \u2018a most terrible\n", "thing has been discovered. Snowball has sold himself to Frederick of Pinchfield\n", "Farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us!\n", "Snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins. But there is worse\n", "than that. We had thought that Snowball\u2019s rebellion was caused simply by his\n", "vanity and ambition. But we were wrong, comrades. Do you know what the\n", "real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was\n", "Jones\u2019s secret agent all the time. It has all been proved by documents which\n", "he left behind him and which we have only just discovered. To my mind this\n", "explains a great deal, comrades. Did we not see for ourselves how he attempted\n", "\u2014 fortunately without success \u2014 to get us defeated and destroyed at the Battle\n", "    The animals were stupefied. This was a wickedness far outdoing Snowball\u2019s\n", "destruction of the windmill. But it was some minutes before they could fully\n", "take it in. They all remembered, or thought they remembered, how they had\n", "seen Snowball charging ahead of them at the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had\n", "rallied and encouraged them at every turn, and how he had not paused for an\n", "instant even when the pellets from Jones\u2019s gun had wounded his back. At first\n", "it was a little difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on Jones\u2019s side.\n", "Even Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. He lay down, tucked\n", "his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to\n", "formulate his thoughts.\n", "    \u2018I do not believe that,\u2019 he said. \u2018Snowball fought bravely at the Battle of the\n", "Cowshed. I saw him myself. Did we not give him \u2019Animal Hero, First Class,\u2019\n", "immediately afterwards?\u2019\n", "    \u2018That was our mistake, comrade. For we know now \u2014 it is all written down\n", "in the secret documents that we have found \u2014 that in reality he was trying to\n", "lure us to our doom.\u2019\n", "    \u2018But he was wounded,\u2019 said Boxer. \u2018We all saw him running with blood.\u2019\n", "    \u2018That was part of the arrangement!\u2019 cried Squealer. \u2018Jones\u2019s shot only\n", "                                        31\n", "\fgrazed him. I could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to read\n", "it. The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for\n", "flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very nearly succeeded \u2014 I will\n", "even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic\n", "Leader, Comrade Napoleon. Do you not remember how, just at the moment\n", "when Jones and his men had got inside the yard, Snowball suddenly turned and\n", "fled, and many animals followed him? And do you not remember, too, that it\n", "was just at that moment, when panic was spreading and all seemed lost, that\n", "Comrade Napoleon sprang forward with a cry of \u2019Death to Humanity!\u2019 and\n", "sank his teeth in Jones\u2019s leg? Surely you remember that, comrades?\u2019 exclaimed\n", "Squealer, frisking from side to side.\n", "    Now when Squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to the\n", "animals that they did remember it. At any rate, they remembered that at the\n", "critical moment of the battle Snowball had turned to flee. But Boxer was still\n", "    \u2018I do not believe that Snowball was a traitor at the beginning,\u2019 he said\n", "finally. \u2018What he has done since is different. But I believe that at the Battle of\n", "the Cowshed he was a good comrade.\u2019\n", "    \u2018Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon,\u2019 announced Squealer, speaking very slowly\n", "and firmly, \u2018has stated categorically \u2014 categorically, comrade \u2014 that Snowball\n", "was Jones\u2019s agent from the very beginning \u2014 yes, and from long before the\n", "Rebellion was ever thought of.\u2019\n", "    \u2018Ah, that is different!\u2019 said Boxer. \u2018If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be\n", "    \u2018That is the true spirit, comrade!\u2019 cried Squealer, but it was noticed he cast\n", "a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes. He turned to go, then\n", "paused and added impressively: \u2018I warn every animal on this farm to keep his\n", "eyes very wide open. For we have reason to think that some of Snowball\u2019s secret\n", "agents are lurking among us at this moment!\u2019\n", "    Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon ordered all the animals to\n", "assemble in the yard. When they were all gathered together, Napoleon emerged\n", "from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had recently awarded\n", "himself \u2018Animal Hero, First Class,\u2019 and \u2018Animal Hero, Second Class\u2019), with his\n", "nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering growls that sent shivers down\n", "all the animals\u2019 spines. They all cowered silently in their places, seeming to\n", "know in advance that some terrible thing was about to happen.\n", "    Napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered a high-\n", "pitched whimper. Immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized four of the\n", "pigs by the ear and dragged them, squealing with pain and terror, to Napoleon\u2019s\n", "feet. The pigs\u2019 ears were bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and for a few mo-\n", "ments they appeared to go quite mad. To the amazement of everybody, three\n", "of them flung themselves upon Boxer. Boxer saw them coming and put out his\n", "great hoof, caught a dog in mid-air, and pinned him to the ground. The dog\n", "shrieked for mercy and the other two fled with their tails between their legs.\n", "Boxer looked at Napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to death\n", "or let it go. Napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply ordered\n", "Boxer to let the dog go, whereat Boxer lifted his hoof, and the dog slunk away,\n", "bruised and howling.\n", "    Presently the tumult died down. The four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt\n", "written on every line of their countenances. Napoleon now called upon them\n", "                                       32\n", "\fto confess their crimes. They were the same four pigs as had protested when\n", "Napoleon abolished the Sunday Meetings. Without any further prompting they\n", "confessed that they had been secretly in touch with Snowball ever since his\n", "expulsion, that they had collaborated with him in destroying the windmill, and\n", "that they had entered into an agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm\n", "to Mr. Frederick. They added that Snowball had privately admitted to them\n", "that he had been Jones\u2019s secret agent for years past. When they had finished\n", "their confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and in a terrible voice\n", "Napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess.\n", "    The three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion\n", "over the eggs now came forward and stated that Snowball had appeared to\n", "them in a dream and incited them to disobey Napoleon\u2019s orders. They, too,\n", "were slaughtered. Then a goose came forward and confessed to having secreted\n", "six ears of corn during the last year\u2019s harvest and eaten them in the night. Then\n", "a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking pool \u2014 urged to do this,\n", "so she said, by Snowball \u2014 and two other sheep confessed to having murdered\n", "an old ram, an especially devoted follower of Napoleon, by chasing him round\n", "and round a bonfire when he was suffering from a cough. They were all slain\n", "on the spot. And so the tale of confessions and executions went on, until there\n", "was a pile of corpses lying before Napoleon\u2019s feet and the air was heavy with\n", "the smell of blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of Jones.\n", "    When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and dogs,\n", "crept away in a body. They were shaken and miserable. They did not know\n", "which was more shocking \u2014 the treachery of the animals who had leagued\n", "themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed. In\n", "the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible, but it\n", "seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among\n", "themselves. Since Jones had left the farm, until today, no animal had killed\n", "another animal. Not even a rat had been killed. They had made their way on\n", "to the little knoll where the half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord\n", "they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth \u2014 Clover, Muriel,\n", "Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens \u2014 everyone,\n", "indeed, except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon\n", "ordered the animals to assemble. For some time nobody spoke. Only Boxer\n", "remained on his feet. He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against\n", "his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. Finally he said:\n", "    \u2018I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could\n", "happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The solution, as\n", "I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier\n", "    And he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry. Having\n", "got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to\n", "the windmill before retiring for the night.\n", "    The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they\n", "were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal\n", "Farm was within their view \u2014 the long pasture stretching down to the main\n", "road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the\n", "young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with\n", "the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring evening. The grass\n", "and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. Never had the\n", "                                        33\n", "\ffarm \u2014 and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm,\n", "every inch of it their own property \u2014 appeared to the animals so desirable a\n", "place. As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears.

But Squealer\n", "counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust in Comrade Napoleon\u2019s strategy.\n", "    Nevertheless, feeling against Frederick continued to run high. One Sunday\n", "morning Napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at\n", "any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to Frederick; he considered it\n", "beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with scoundrels of that description.\n", "The pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the Rebellion were\n", "forbidden to set foot anywhere on Foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their\n", "former slogan of \u2018Death to Humanity\u2019 in favour of \u2018Death to Frederick.\u2019 In the\n", "late summer yet another of Snowball\u2019s machinations was laid bare. The wheat\n", "crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits\n", "Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. A gander who had been\n", "privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to Squealer and immediately committed\n", "suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries.

They were struck dumb with surprise when Napoleon announced that he\n", "had sold the pile of timber to Frederick. Tomorrow Frederick\u2019s wagons would\n", "arrive and begin carting it away. Throughout the whole period of his seeming\n", "friendship with Pilkington, Napoleon had really been in secret agreement with\n", "    All relations with Foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages had been\n", "sent to Pilkington. The pigeons had been told to avoid Pinchfield Farm and to\n", "alter their slogan from \u2018Death to Frederick\u2019 to \u2018Death to Pilkington.\u2019 At the\n", "same time Napoleon assured the animals that the stories of an impending attack\n", "on Animal Farm were completely untrue, and that the tales about Frederick\u2019s\n", "cruelty to his own animals had been greatly exaggerated. All these rumours\n", "had probably originated with Snowball and his agents. It now appeared that\n", "Snowball was not, after all, hiding on Pinchfield Farm, and in fact had never\n", "been there in his life: he was living \u2014 in considerable luxury, so it was said \u2014\n", "at Foxwood, and had in reality been a pensioner of Pilkington for years past.\n", "    The pigs were in ecstasies over Napoleon\u2019s cunning. By seeming to be\n", "friendly with Pilkington he had forced Frederick to raise his price by twelve\n", "pounds. But the superior quality of Napoleon\u2019s mind, said Squealer, was shown\n", "in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even Frederick. Frederick had wanted\n", "to pay for the timber with something called a cheque, which, it seemed, was a\n", "piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon it. But Napoleon was too\n", "clever for him. He had demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were\n", "to be handed over before the timber was removed. Already Frederick had paid\n", "up; and the sum he had paid was just enough to buy the machinery for the\n", "    Meanwhile the timber was being carted away at high speed. When it was all\n", "gone, another special meeting was held in the barn for the animals to inspect\n", "Frederick\u2019s bank-notes. Smiling beatifically, and wearing both his decorations,\n", "Napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on the platform, with the money at his\n", "side, neatly piled on a china dish from the farmhouse kitchen. The animals filed\n", "slowly past, and each gazed his fill. And Boxer put out his nose to sniff at the\n", "bank-notes, and the flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath.\n", "    Three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo. Whymper, his face deadly\n", "pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle, flung it down in the yard and\n", "rushed straight into the farmhouse. The next moment a choking roar of rage\n", "sounded from Napoleon\u2019s apartments. The news of what had happened sped\n", "round the farm like wildfire. The banknotes were forgeries! Frederick had got\n", "the timber for nothing!\n", "    Napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible voice\n", "pronounced the death sentence upon Frederick. When captured, he said, Fred-\n", "erick should be boiled alive. At the same time he warned them that after this\n", "                                      38\n", "\ftreacherous deed the worst was to be expected. Frederick and his men might\n", "make their long-expected attack at any moment. Sentinels were placed at all the\n", "approaches to the farm. In addition, four pigeons were sent to Foxwood with a\n", "conciliatory message, which it was hoped might re-establish good relations with\n", "    The very next morning the attack came. The animals were at breakfast when\n", "the look-outs came racing in with the news that Frederick and his followers had\n", "already come through the five-barred gate. Boldly enough the animals sallied\n", "forth to meet them, but this time they did not have the easy victory that they\n", "had had in the Battle of the Cowshed. There were fifteen men, with half a dozen\n", "guns between them, and they opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards.\n", "The animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and\n", "in spite of the efforts of Napoleon and Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven\n", "back. A number of them were already wounded. They took refuge in the farm\n", "buildings and peeped cautiously out from chinks and knot-holes. The whole of\n", "the big pasture, including the windmill, was in the hands of the enemy. For\n", "the moment even Napoleon seemed at a loss. He paced up and down without\n", "a word, his tail rigid and twitching. Wistful glances were sent in the direction\n", "of Fox wood. If Pilkington and his men would help them, the day might yet be\n", "won. But at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent out on the day\n", "before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from Pilkington. On it\n", "was pencilled the words: \u2018Serves you right.\u2019\n", "    Meanwhile Frederick and his men had halted about the windmill. The an-\n", "imals watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round. Two of the men\n", "had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. They were going to knock the\n", "    \u2018Impossible!\u2019 cried Napoleon. \u2018We have built the walls far too thick for that.\n", "They could not knock it down in a week. Courage, comrades!\u2019\n", "    But Benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently. The two\n", "with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base of the\n", "windmill. Slowly, and with an air almost of amusement, Benjamin nodded his\n", "    \u2018I thought so,\u2019 he said. \u2018Do you not see what they are doing? In another\n", "moment they are going to pack blasting powder into that hole.\u2019\n", "    Terrified, the animals waited. It was impossible now to venture out of the\n", "shelter of the buildings. After a few minutes the men were seen to be running\n", "in all directions. Then there was a deafening roar. The pigeons swirled into the\n", "air, and all the animals, except Napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies\n", "and hid their faces. When they got up again, a huge cloud of black smoke was\n", "hanging where the windmill had been. Slowly the breeze drifted it away. The\n", "windmill had ceased to exist!\n", "    At this sight the animals\u2019 courage returned to them. The fear and despair\n", "they had felt a moment earlier were drowned in their rage against this vile,\n", "contemptible act. A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for\n", "further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy.\n", "This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail.\n", "It was a savage, bitter battle. The men fired again and again, and, when the\n", "animals got to close quarters, lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots.\n", "A cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded.\n", "Even Napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had the tip of his\n", "                                       39\n", "\ftail chipped by a pellet. But the men did not go unscathed either. Three of\n", "them had their heads broken by blows from Boxer\u2019s hoofs; another was gored\n", "in the belly by a cow\u2019s horn; another had his trousers nearly torn off by Jessie\n", "and Bluebell. And when the nine dogs of Napoleon\u2019s own bodyguard, whom he\n", "had instructed to make a detour under cover of the hedge, suddenly appeared\n", "on the men\u2019s flank, baying ferociously, panic overtook them. They saw that\n", "they were in danger of being surrounded. Frederick shouted to his men to get\n", "out while the going was good, and the next moment the cowardly enemy was\n", "running for dear life. The animals chased them right down to the bottom of the\n", "field, and got in some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the\n", "    They had won, but they were weary and bleeding. Slowly they began to\n", "limp back towards the farm. The sight of their dead comrades stretched upon\n", "the grass moved some of them to tears. And for a little while they halted in\n", "sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood. Yes, it was\n", "gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone! Even the foundations were\n", "partially destroyed. And in rebuilding it they could not this time, as before,\n", "make use of the fallen stones. This time the stones had vanished too. The force\n", "of the explosion had flung them to distances of hundreds of yards. It was as\n", "though the windmill had never been.\n", "    As they approached the farm Squealer, who had unaccountably been absent\n", "during the fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and beam-\n", "ing with satisfaction. And the animals heard, from the direction of the farm\n", "buildings, the solemn booming of a gun.\n", "    \u2018What is that gun firing for?\u2019 said Boxer.\n", "    \u2018To celebrate our victory!\u2019 cried Squealer.\n", "    \u2018What victory?\u2019 said Boxer. His knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe and\n", "split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind leg.\n", "    \u2018What victory, comrade? Have we not driven the enemy off our soil \u2014 the\n", "sacred soil of Animal Farm?\u2019\n", "    \u2018But they have destroyed the windmill. And we had worked on it for two\n", "    \u2018What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six windmills\n", "if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we\n", "have done. The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand\n", "upon. And now \u2014 thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon \u2014 we have\n", "won every inch of it back again!\u2019\n", "    \u2018Then we have won back what we had before,\u2019 said Boxer.\n", "    \u2018That is our victory,\u2019 said Squealer.\n", "    They limped into the yard. The pellets under the skin of Boxer\u2019s leg smarted\n", "painfully. He saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the windmill from\n", "the foundations, and already in imagination he braced himself for the task. But\n", "for the first time it occurred to him that he was eleven years old and that\n", "perhaps his great muscles were not quite what they had once been.\n", "    But when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing\n", "again \u2014 seven times it was fired in all \u2014 and heard the speech that Napoleon\n", "made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all that\n", "they had won a great victory. The animals slain in the battle were given a\n", "solemn funeral. Boxer and Clover pulled the wagon which served as a hearse,\n", "and Napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession. Two whole days\n", "                                      40\n", "\fwere given over to celebrations. There were songs, speeches, and more firing of\n", "the gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed on every animal, with two\n", "ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for each dog. It was announced\n", "that the battle would be called the Battle of the Windmill, and that Napoleon\n", "had created a new decoration, the Order of the Green Banner, which he had\n", "conferred upon himself. In the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the\n", "banknotes was forgotten.\n", "    It was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of whisky\n", "in the cellars of the farmhouse. It had been overlooked at the time when the\n", "house was first occupied. That night there came from the farmhouse the sound\n", "of loud singing, in which, to everyone\u2019s surprise, the strains of Beasts of England\n", "were mixed up. At about half past nine Napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of\n", "Mr. Jones\u2019s, was distinctly seen to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly\n", "round the yard, and disappear in doors again. But in the morning a deep silence\n", "hung over the farmhouse. Not a pig appeared to be stirring. It was nearly nine\n", "o\u2019clock when Squealer made his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his\n", "eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of\n", "being seriously ill. He called the animals together and told them that he had a\n", "terrible piece of news to impart. Comrade Napoleon was dying!\n", "    A cry of lamentation went up. Straw was laid down outside the doors of\n", "the farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. With tears in their eyes\n", "they asked one another what they should do if their Leader were taken away\n", "from them. A rumour went round that Snowball had after all contrived to\n", "introduce poison into Napoleon\u2019s food. At eleven o\u2019clock Squealer came out to\n", "make another announcement. As his last act upon earth, Comrade Napoleon\n", "had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be punished by\n", "    By the evening, however, Napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and\n", "the following morning Squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the\n", "way to recovery. By the evening of that day Napoleon was back at work, and\n", "on the next day it was learned that he had instructed Whymper to purchase\n", "in Willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling. A week later Napoleon\n", "gave orders that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it had previously\n", "been intended to set aside as a grazing-ground for animals who were past work,\n", "was to be ploughed up. It was given out that the pasture was exhausted and\n", "needed re-seeding; but it soon became known that Napoleon intended to sow it\n", "    About this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone was\n", "able to understand. One night at about twelve o\u2019clock there was a loud crash\n", "in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. It was a moonlit night.\n", "At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments\n", "were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces. Squealer, temporarily\n", "stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand there lay a lantern, a paint-\n", "brush, and an overturned pot of white paint. The dogs immediately made a\n", "ring round Squealer, and escorted him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was\n", "able to walk. None of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant,\n", "except old Benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed\n", "to understand, but would say nothing.\n", "    But a few days later Muriel, reading over the Seven Commandments to\n", "herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had\n", "                                        41\n", "\fremembered wrong. They had thought the Fifth Commandment was \u2018No animal\n", "shall drink alcohol,\u2019 but there were two words that they had forgotten. Actually\n", "the Commandment read: \u2018No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.\u2019\n", "                                      42\n", "Boxer\u2019s split hoof was a long time in healing. They had started the rebuilding\n", "of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were ended. Boxer refused\n", "to take even a day off work, and made it a point of honour not to let it be seen\n", "that he was in pain. In the evenings he would admit privately to Clover that\n", "the hoof troubled him a great deal. Clover treated the hoof with poultices of\n", "herbs which she prepared by chewing them, and both she and Benjamin urged\n", "Boxer to work less hard. \u2018A horse\u2019s lungs do not last for ever,\u2019 she said to him.\n", "But Boxer would not listen. He had, he said, only one real ambition left \u2014 to\n", "see the windmill well under way before he reached the age for retirement.\n", "    At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated, the\n", "retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen,\n", "for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at five. Liberal\n", "old-age pensions had been agreed upon. As yet no animal had actually retired\n", "on pension, but of late the subject had been discussed more and more. Now\n", "that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley, it was\n", "rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned\n", "into a grazing-ground for superannuated animals. For a horse, it was said, the\n", "pension would be five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay,\n", "with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays. Boxer\u2019s twelfth birthday\n", "was due in the late summer of the following year.\n", "    Meanwhile life was hard. The winter was as cold as the last one had been,\n", "and food was even shorter. Once again all rations were reduced, except those\n", "of the pigs and the dogs. A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained,\n", "would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism. In any case he had\n", "no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were not in reality short\n", "of food, whatever the appearances might be. For the time being, certainly, it\n", "had been found necessary to make a readjustment of rations (Squealer always\n", "spoke of it as a \u2018readjustment,\u2019 never as a \u2018reduction\u2019), but in comparison with\n", "the days of Jones, the improvement was enormous. Reading out the figures in\n", "a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more\n", "hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones\u2019s day, that they worked shorter\n", "hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer,\n", "that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they\n", "had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. The animals believed\n", "every word of it. Truth to tell, Jones and all he stood for had almost faded out\n", "of their memories. They knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they\n", "were often hungry and often cold, and that they were usually working when\n", "they were not asleep. But doubtless it had been worse in the old days. They\n", "were glad to believe so. Besides, in those days they had been slaves and now\n", "                                       43\n", "\fthey were free, and that made all the difference, as Squealer did not fail to point\n", "    There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four sows\n", "had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between\n", "them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar on\n", "the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. It was announced that\n", "later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a schoolroom would be built\n", "in the farmhouse garden. For the time being, the young pigs were given their\n", "instruction by Napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen. They took their\n", "exercise in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with the other young\n", "animals. About this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and\n", "any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also\n", "that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green\n", "ribbons on their tails on Sundays.\n", "    The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money. There\n", "were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased, and it would\n", "also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery for the windmill.\n", "Then there were lamp oil and candles for the house, sugar for Napoleon\u2019s own\n", "table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the ground that it made them fat),\n", "and all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron,\n", "and dog biscuits. A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off,\n", "and the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that year\n", "the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level.\n", "Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in February, and lanterns in\n", "the stalls were forbidden to save Oil. But the pigs seemed comfortable enough,\n", "and in fact were putting on weight if anything. One afternoon in late February\n", "a warm, rich, appetising scent, such as the animals had never smelt before,\n", "wafted itself across the yard from the little brew-house, which had been disused\n", "in Jones\u2019s time, and which stood beyond the kitchen. Someone said it was the\n", "smell of cooking barley. The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered\n", "whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm\n", "mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from now\n", "onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs. The field beyond the orchard\n", "had already been sown with barley. And the news soon leaked out that every\n", "pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily, with half a gallon for\n", "Napoleon himself, which was always served to him in the Crown Derby soup\n", "    But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the fact\n", "that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before. There were more\n", "songs, more speeches, more processions. Napoleon had commanded that once a\n", "week there should be held something called a Spontaneous Demonstration, the\n", "object of which was to celebrate the struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm.\n", "At the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round\n", "the precincts of the farm in military formation, with the pigs leading, then the\n", "horses, then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry. The dogs flanked\n", "the procession and at the head of all marched Napoleon\u2019s black cockerel. Boxer\n", "and Clover always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof\n", "and the horn and the caption, \u2018Long live Comrade Napoleon!\u2019 Afterwards there\n", "were recitations of poems composed in Napoleon\u2019s honour, and a speech by\n", "Squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs,\n", "                                        44\n", "\fand on occasion a shot was fired from the gun.

They found it comforting\n", "to be reminded that, after all, they were truly their own masters and that the\n", "work they did was for their own benefit. So that, what with the songs, the\n", "processions, Squealer\u2019s lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of\n", "the cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their\n", "bellies were empty, at least part of the time.\n", "    In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became necessary\n", "to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was elected\n", "unanimously. On the same day it was given out that fresh documents had\n", "been discovered which revealed further details about Snowball\u2019s complicity with\n", "Jones. It now appeared that Snowball had not, as the animals had previously\n", "imagined, merely attempted to lose the Battle of the Cowshed by means of\n", "a stratagem, but had been openly fighting on Jones\u2019s side. In fact, it was\n", "he who had actually been the leader of the human forces, and had charged\n", "into battle with the words \u2018Long live Humanity!\u2019 on his lips. The wounds on\n", "Snowball\u2019s back, which a few of the animals still remembered to have seen, had\n", "been inflicted by Napoleon\u2019s teeth.\n", "    In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the\n", "farm, after an absence of several years. He was quite unchanged, still did no\n", "work, and talked in the same strain as ever about Sugarcandy Mountain. He\n", "would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to anyone\n", "who would listen. \u2018Up there, comrades,\u2019 he would say solemnly, pointing to the\n", "sky with his large beak \u2014 \u2018up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that\n", "you can see \u2014 there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we\n", "poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!\u2019 He even claimed to have been\n", "there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover\n", "and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges. Many of the animals\n", "believed him. Their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it\n", "not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else? A thing that\n", "was difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses. They all\n", "declared contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy Mountain were lies,\n", "and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an allowance\n", "of a gill of beer a day.\n", "    After his hoof had healed up, Boxer worked harder than ever. Indeed, all the\n", "animals worked like slaves that year. Apart from the regular work of the farm,\n", "and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the schoolhouse for the young\n", "pigs, which was started in March. Sometimes the long hours on insufficient\n", "food were hard to bear, but Boxer never faltered. In nothing that he said or did\n", "was there any sign that his strength was not what it had been. It was only his\n", "appearance that was a little altered; his hide was less shiny than it had used to\n", "be, and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken. The others said, \u2018Boxer\n", "will pick up when the spring grass comes on\u2019; but the spring came and Boxer\n", "grew no fatter. Sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when\n", "he braced his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that\n", "nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue. At such times his lips\n", "                                         45\n", "\fwere seen to form the words, \u2018I will work harder\u2019; he had no voice left.

He did not care what\n", "happened so long as a good store of stone was accumulated before he went on\n", "    Late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm that\n", "something had happened to Boxer. He had gone out alone to drag a load of\n", "stone down to the windmill. And sure enough, the rumour was true. A few\n", "minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news: \u2018Boxer has fallen! He\n", "is lying on his side and can\u2019t get up!\u2019\n", "    About half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the wind-\n", "mill stood. There lay Boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck stretched\n", "out, unable even to raise his head. His eyes were glazed, his sides matted with\n", "sweat. A thin stream of blood had trickled out of his mouth. Clover dropped\n", "to her knees at his side.\n", "    \u2018Boxer!\u2019 she cried, \u2018how are you?\u2019\n", "    \u2018It is my lung,\u2019 said Boxer in a weak voice. \u2018It does not matter. I think you\n", "will be able to finish the windmill without me. There is a pretty good store of\n", "stone accumulated. I had only another month to go in any case. To tell you the\n", "truth, I had been looking forward to my retirement. And perhaps, as Benjamin\n", "is growing old too, they will let him retire at the same time and be a companion\n", "    \u2018We must get help at once,\u2019 said Clover. \u2018Run, somebody, and tell Squealer\n", "    All the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give\n", "Squealer the news. Only Clover remained, and Benjamin who lay down at\n", "Boxer\u2019s side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long tail. Af-\n", "ter about a quarter of an hour Squealer appeared, full of sympathy and concern.\n", "He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of\n", "this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on the farm, and was already\n", "making arrangements to send Boxer to be treated in the hospital at Willingdon.\n", "The animals felt a little uneasy at this. Except for Mollie and Snowball, no\n", "other animal had ever left the farm, and they did not like to think of their sick\n", "comrade in the hands of human beings. However, Squealer easily convinced\n", "them that the veterinary surgeon in Willingdon could treat Boxer\u2019s case more\n", "satisfactorily than could be done on the farm. And about half an hour later,\n", "when Boxer had somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet,\n", "and managed to limp back to his stall, where Clover and Benjamin had prepared\n", "a good bed of straw for him.\n", "    For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall. The pigs had sent out a\n", "large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest in the\n", "bathroom, and Clover administered it to Boxer twice a day after meals. In the\n", "evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while Benjamin kept the flies off\n", "him. Boxer professed not to be sorry for what had happened. If he made a good\n", "recovery, he might expect to live another three years, and he looked forward to\n", "the peaceful days that he would spend in the corner of the big pasture. It\n", "would be the first time that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind.\n", "He intended, he said, to devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining\n", "twenty-two letters of the alphabet.\n", "    However, Benjamin and Clover could only be with Boxer after working hours,\n", "                                        46\n", "\fand it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away. The\n", "animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when\n", "they were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the\n", "farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. It was the first time that they\n", "had ever seen Benjamin excited \u2014 indeed, it was the first time that anyone\n", "had ever seen him gallop. \u2018Quick, quick!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Come at once! They\u2019re\n", "taking Boxer away!\u2019 Without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals broke\n", "off work and raced back to the farm buildings. Sure enough, there in the yard\n", "was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with lettering on its side and a\n", "sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver\u2019s seat. And\n", "Boxer\u2019s stall was empty.\n", "    The animals crowded round the van. \u2018Good-bye, Boxer!\u2019 they chorused,\n", "    \u2018Fools! Fools!\u2019 shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the\n", "earth with his small hoofs. \u2018Fools! Do you not see what is written on the side\n", "    That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to spell\n", "out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly\n", "    \u2018Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer\n", "in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied.\u2019 Do you not understand what that\n", "means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker\u2019s!\u2019\n", "    A cry of horror burst from all the animals. At this moment the man on the\n", "box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart trot.\n", "All the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices. Clover forced her\n", "way to the front. The van began to gather speed. Clover tried to stir her stout\n", "limbs to a gallop, and achieved a canter. \u2018Boxer!\u2019 she cried. \u2018Boxer! Boxer!\n", "Boxer!\u2019 And just at this moment, as though he had heard the uproar outside,\n", "Boxer\u2019s face, with the white stripe down his nose, appeared at the small window\n", "at the back of the van.\n", "    \u2018Boxer!\u2019 cried Clover in a terrible voice. \u2018Boxer! Get out! Get out quickly!\n", "They\u2019re taking you to your death!\u2019\n", "    All the animals took up the cry of \u2018Get out, Boxer, get out!\u2019 But the van\n", "was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. It was uncertain\n", "whether Boxer had understood what Clover had said. But a moment later his\n", "face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous\n", "drumming of hoofs inside the van. He was trying to kick his way out. The time\n", "had been when a few kicks from Boxer\u2019s hoofs would have smashed the van\n", "to matchwood. But alas! his strength had left him; and in a few moments the\n", "sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and died away. In desperation the animals\n", "began appealing to the two horses which drew the van to stop. \u2018Comrades,\n", "comrades!\u2019 they shouted. \u2018Don\u2019t take your own brother to his death!\u2019 But the\n", "stupid brutes, too ignorant to realise what was happening, merely set back their\n", "ears and quickened their pace. Boxer\u2019s face did not reappear at the window.\n", "Too late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate;\n", "but in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down\n", "the road. Boxer was never seen again.\n", "    Three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at Will-\n", "ingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have. Squealer came\n", "to announce the news to the others. He had, he said, been present during\n", "                                        47\n", "\fBoxer\u2019s last hours.\n", "    \u2018It was the most affecting sight I have ever seen!\u2019 said Squealer, lifting his\n", "trotter and wiping away a tear. \u2018I was at his bedside at the very last. And at\n", "the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that his sole sorrow\n", "was to have passed on before the windmill was finished. \u2019Forward, comrades!\u2019\n", "he whispered. \u2019Forward in the name of the Rebellion. Long live Animal Farm!\n", "Long live Comrade Napoleon! Napoleon is always right.\u2019 Those were his very\n", "last words, comrades.\u2019\n", "    Here Squealer\u2019s demeanour suddenly changed. He fell silent for a moment,\n", "and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he proceeded.\n", "    It had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked rumour had\n", "been circulated at the time of Boxer\u2019s removal. Some of the animals had noticed\n", "that the van which took Boxer away was marked \u2018Horse Slaughterer,\u2019 and had\n", "actually jumped to the conclusion that Boxer was being sent to the knacker\u2019s.\n", "It was almost unbelievable, said Squealer, that any animal could be so stupid.\n", "Surely, he cried indignantly, whisking his tail and skipping from side to side,\n", "surely they knew their beloved Leader, Comrade Napoleon, better than that?\n", "But the explanation was really very simple. The van had previously been the\n", "property of the knacker, and had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, who\n", "had not yet painted the old name out. That was how the mistake had arisen.\n", "    The animals were enormously relieved to hear this. And when Squealer went\n", "on to give further graphic details of Boxer\u2019s death-bed, the admirable care he\n", "had received, and the expensive medicines for which Napoleon had paid without\n", "a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they\n", "felt for their comrade\u2019s death was tempered by the thought that at least he had\n", "    Napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following Sunday morning\n", "and pronounced a short oration in Boxer\u2019s honour. It had not been possible,\n", "he said, to bring back their lamented comrade\u2019s remains for interment on the\n", "farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels in the\n", "farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on Boxer\u2019s grave. And in a few\n", "days\u2019 time the pigs intended to hold a memorial banquet in Boxer\u2019s honour.\n", "Napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of Boxer\u2019s two favourite maxims, \u2018I\n", "will work harder\u2019 and \u2018Comrade Napoleon is always right\u2019 \u2014 maxims, he said,\n", "which every animal would do well to adopt as his own.\n", "    On the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer\u2019s van drove up from Will-\n", "ingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse. That night there\n", "was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like\n", "a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o\u2019clock with a tremendous crash of\n", "glass. No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and\n", "the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the\n", "money to buy themselves another case of whisky.\n", "                                        48\n", "Years passed. The seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled by. A\n", "time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the\n", "Rebellion, except Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and a number of the pigs.\n", "     Muriel was dead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were dead. Jones too was\n", "dead \u2014 he had died in an inebriates\u2019 home in another part of the country.\n", "Snowball was forgotten. Boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had known\n", "him. Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency\n", "to rheumy eyes. She was two years past the retiring age, but in fact no animal\n", "had ever actually retired. The talk of setting aside a corner of the pasture\n", "for superannuated animals had long since been dropped. Napoleon was now\n", "a mature boar of twenty-four stone. Squealer was so fat that he could with\n", "difficulty see out of his eyes. Only old Benjamin was much the same as ever,\n", "except for being a little greyer about the muzzle, and, since Boxer\u2019s death, more\n", "morose and taciturn than ever.\n", "     There were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase was\n", "not so great as had been expected in earlier years. Many animals had been\n", "born to whom the Rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of\n", "mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a\n", "thing before their arrival. The farm possessed three horses now besides Clover.\n", "They were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and good comrades, but very\n", "stupid. None of them proved able to learn the alphabet beyond the letter B.\n", "They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the\n", "principles of Animalism, especially from Clover, for whom they had an almost\n", "filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood very much of it.\n", "     The farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even been\n", "enlarged by two fields which had been bought from Mr. Pilkington. The wind-\n", "mill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a thresh-\n", "ing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings had been\n", "added to it. Whymper had bought himself a dogcart. The windmill, however,\n", "had not after all been used for generating electrical power. It was used for\n", "milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit. The animals were hard\n", "at work building yet another windmill; when that one was finished, so it was\n", "said, the dynamos would be installed. But the luxuries of which Snowball had\n", "once taught the animals to dream, the stalls with electric light and hot and\n", "cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer talked about. Napoleon\n", "had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of Animalism. The truest\n", "happiness, he said, lay in working hard and living frugally.\n", "     Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making\n", "the animals themselves any richer \u2014 except, of course, for the pigs and the\n", "                                       49\n", "\fdogs. Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many\n", "dogs. It was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion. There\n", "was, as Squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the supervision\n", "and organisation of the farm. Much of this work was of a kind that the other\n", "animals were too ignorant to understand. For example, Squealer told them that\n", "the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things\n", "called \u2018files,\u2019 \u2018reports,\u2019 \u2018minutes,\u2019 and \u2018memoranda.\u2019 These were large sheets of\n", "paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as soon as they were so\n", "covered, they were burnt in the furnace. This was of the highest importance for\n", "the welfare of the farm, Squealer said. But still, neither pigs nor dogs produced\n", "any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their\n", "appetites were always good.\n", "    As for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always been.\n", "They were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the pool, they\n", "laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the cold, and in summer\n", "by the flies. Sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories\n", "and tried to determine whether in the early days of the Rebellion, when Jones\u2019s\n", "expulsion was still recent, things had been better or worse than now. They\n", "could not remember. There was nothing with which they could compare their\n", "present lives: they had nothing to go upon except Squealer\u2019s lists of figures,\n", "which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better.\n", "The animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for\n", "speculating on such things now. Only old Benjamin professed to remember\n", "every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever\n", "could be much better or much worse \u2014 hunger, hardship, and disappointment\n", "being, so he said, the unalterable law of life.\n", "    And yet the animals never gave up hope. More, they never lost, even for\n", "an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal\n", "Farm. They were still the only farm in the whole county \u2014 in all England!\n", "\u2014 owned and operated by animals. Not one of them, not even the youngest,\n", "not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles\n", "away, ever ceased to marvel at that. And when they heard the gun booming\n", "and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with\n", "imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the\n", "expulsion of Jones, the writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in\n", "which the human invaders had been defeated. None of the old dreams had been\n", "abandoned. The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the\n", "green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed\n", "in. Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be within the\n", "lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming. Even the tune of\n", "Beasts of England was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate,\n", "it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have\n", "dared to sing it aloud. It might be that their lives were hard and that not all\n", "of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as\n", "other animals. If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human\n", "beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. No creature\n", "among them went upon two legs. No creature called any other creature \u2018Master.\u2019\n", "All animals were equal.\n", "    One day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led\n", "them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which had\n", "                                       50\n", "\fbecome overgrown with birch saplings. The sheep spent the whole day there\n", "browsing at the leaves under Squealer\u2019s supervision. In the evening he returned\n", "to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm weather, told the sheep to stay\n", "where they were. It ended by their remaining there for a whole week, during\n", "which time the other animals saw nothing of them. Squealer was with them for\n", "the greater part of every day. He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new\n", "song, for which privacy was needed.\n", "    It was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the\n", "animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm buildings,\n", "that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard. Startled, the\n", "animals stopped in their tracks. It was Clover\u2019s voice. She neighed again, and\n", "all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the yard. Then they saw\n", "what Clover had seen.\n", "    It was a pig walking on his hind legs.\n", "    Yes, it was Squealer. A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to sup-\n", "porting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect balance, he was\n", "strolling across the yard. And a moment later, out from the door of the farm-\n", "house came a long file of pigs, all walking on their hind legs. Some did it better\n", "than others, one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they\n", "would have liked the support of a stick, but every one of them made his way\n", "right round the yard successfully. And finally there was a tremendous baying\n", "of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came Napoleon\n", "himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and\n", "with his dogs gambolling round him.\n", "    He carried a whip in his trotter.\n", "    There was a deadly silence. Amazed, terrified, huddling together, the an-\n", "imals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard. It was as\n", "though the world had turned upside-down. Then there came a moment when\n", "the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of everything \u2014 in spite of their\n", "terror of the dogs, and of the habit, developed through long years, of never\n", "complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened \u2014 they might have\n", "uttered some word of protest. But just at that moment, as though at a signal,\n", "all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of \u2014\n", "    \u2018Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs\n", "good, two legs better!\u2019\n", "    It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep\n", "had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had\n", "marched back into the farmhouse.\n", "    Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. He looked round. It was\n", "Clover. Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. Without saying anything, she\n", "tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn, where\n", "the Seven Commandments were written. For a minute or two they stood gazing\n", "at the tatted wall with its white lettering.\n", "    \u2018My sight is failing,\u2019 she said finally. \u2018Even when I was young I could not have\n", "read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different.\n", "Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?\u2019\n", "    For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her\n", "what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a single\n", "Commandment. It ran:\n", "ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL\n", "                                        51\n", "\fBUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS\n", "    After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were su-\n", "pervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters. It did not\n", "seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set, were\n", "arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out subscriptions to John Bull,\n", "TitBits, and the Daily Mirror. It did not seem strange when Napoleon was\n", "seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth \u2014 no, not even\n", "when the pigs took Mr. Jones\u2019s clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on,\n", "Napoleon himself appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather\n", "leggings, while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs.\n", "Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.\n", "    A week later, in the afternoon, a number of dogcarts drove up to the farm.\n", "A deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited to make a tour of in-\n", "spection. They were shown all over the farm, and expressed great admiration\n", "for everything they saw, especially the windmill. The animals were weeding the\n", "turnip field. They worked diligently, hardly raising their faces from the ground,\n", "and not knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human\n", "    That evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the farmhouse.\n", "And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were stricken\n", "with curiosity. What could be happening in there, now that for the first time\n", "animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality? With one accord\n", "they began to creep as quietly as possible into the farmhouse garden.\n", "    At the gate they paused, half frightened to go on but Clover led the way\n", "in. They tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough peered\n", "in at the dining-room window. There, round the long table, sat half a dozen\n", "farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs, Napoleon himself occupying\n", "the seat of honour at the head of the table. The pigs appeared completely at\n", "ease in their chairs. The company had been enjoying a game of cards but had\n", "broken off for the moment, evidently in order to drink a toast. A large jug was\n", "circulating, and the mugs were being refilled with beer. No one noticed the\n", "wondering faces of the animals that gazed in at the window.\n", "    Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. In a\n", "moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. But\n", "before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to\n", "    It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said \u2014 and, he was sure, to all\n", "others present \u2014 to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding\n", "had now come to an end. There had been a time \u2014 not that he, or any of\n", "the present company, had shared such sentiments \u2014 but there had been a time\n", "when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm had been regarded, he would\n", "not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their\n", "human neighbours. Unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had\n", "been current. It had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated\n", "by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in\n", "the neighbourhood. Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that\n", "on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail. They had been\n", "nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human\n", "employees. But all such doubts were now dispelled. Today he and his friends\n", "had visited Animal Farm and inspected every inch of it with their own eyes, and\n", "                                        52\n", "\fwhat did they find? Not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline\n", "and an orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere. He\n", "believed that he was right in saying that the lower animals on Animal Farm did\n", "more work and received less food than any animals in the county. Indeed, he\n", "and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features which they intended\n", "to introduce on their own farms immediately.\n", "    He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly\n", "feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal Farm and its\n", "neighbours. Between pigs and human beings there was not, and there need\n", "not be, any clash of interests whatever. Their struggles and their difficulties\n", "were one. Was not the labour problem the same everywhere? Here it became\n", "apparent that Mr. Pilkington was about to spring some carefully prepared\n", "witticism on the company, but for a moment he was too overcome by amusement\n", "to be able to utter it. After much choking, during which his various chins turned\n", "purple, he managed to get it out: \u2018If you have your lower animals to contend\n", "with,\u2019 he said, \u2018we have our lower classes!\u2019 This bon mot set the table in a\n", "roar; and Mr. Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations,\n", "the long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had\n", "observed on Animal Farm.\n", "    And now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to their feet and\n", "make certain that their glasses were full. \u2018Gentlemen,\u2019 concluded Mr. Pilking-\n", "ton, \u2018gentlemen, I give you a toast: To the prosperity of Animal Farm!\u2019\n", "    There was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. Napoleon was so grat-\n", "ified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug against Mr.\n", "Pilkington\u2019s before emptying it. When the cheering had died down, Napoleon,\n", "who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too had a few words to say.\n", "    Like all of Napoleon\u2019s speeches, it was short and to the point. He too, he said,\n", "was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end. For a long time\n", "there had been rumours \u2014 circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant\n", "enemy \u2014 that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the\n", "outlook of himself and his colleagues. They had been credited with attempting\n", "to stir up rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms. Nothing could\n", "be further from the truth! Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at\n", "peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours. This farm which\n", "he had the honour to control, he added, was a co-operative enterprise. The\n", "title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs jointly.\n", "    He did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered, but\n", "certain changes had been made recently in the routine of the farm which should\n", "have the effect of promoting confidence stiff further. Hitherto the animals on the\n", "farm had had a rather foolish custom of addressing one another as \u2018Comrade.\u2019\n", "This was to be suppressed. There had also been a very strange custom, whose\n", "origin was unknown, of marching every Sunday morning past a boar\u2019s skull\n", "which was nailed to a post in the garden. This, too, would be suppressed, and\n", "the skull had already been buried. His visitors might have observed, too, the\n", "green flag which flew from the masthead.
